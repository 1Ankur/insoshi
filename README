# Insoshi social software

First, join the Insoshi Google group at

http://groups.google.com/group/insoshi/subscribe

Then get started with Insoshi.  If you encounter problems, be sure to refer to the Trac wiki at http://trac.insoshi.com/, which expands on some of the points here.

NOTE: We're currently working on updating our Trac wiki to reflect the Insoshi repository (http://github.com/insoshi/insoshi) hosted on GitHub (http://github.com)

## Get Git

The source code to Insoshi is hosted by Git, a version control system developed by Linus Torvalds to host the Linux kernel.  The first step is to install it from here:

http://git.or.cz/

Linux and Mac users should have no problems; Windows users might have to install Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/) first.

## Install libraries and gems

### Libraries

You'll need to install FreeImage, SQLite, and (optionally) MySQL.  Install instructions for all three are easy to find using Google.

### Gems

You probably have Rails already, but might not have the others.

$ sudo gem install rails
$ sudo gem install image_science
$ sudo gem install ferret
$ sudo gem install mysql
$ sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby
$ sudo gem install BlueCloth

## Installing the app

Here are the steps to get up and running with the Insoshi Rails app.

### Git steps

The repository is large enough (mainly due to the frozen Rails gems) that it may take a while to finish the first step, which is to clone the repository:

$ git clone git://git.insoshi.com/insoshi.git

Then make a Git branch for yourself:

$ git checkout -b <firstname_lastname>

where you should replace <firstname_lastname> with your name (without angle brackets!).  

At some later point, follow the steps at

http://trac.insoshi.com/insoshi/wiki/ContributingBack

Also be sure to get in the habit of syncing with the main repository:

$ git add .
$ git commit -v
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout <firstname_lastname>
$ git rebase master

### Config files and tests

Now create the config files:

$ cp config/database.example config/database.yml
$ cp config/initializers/preferences.rb.example \
     config/initializers/preferences.rb

Installation itself is handled by a custom Rake task:     

$ rake install

Then run the tests (which are actually RSpec examples in the spec/ directory):

$ rake db:test:prepare
$ rake spec

(If the tests fail in the Photos controller test, double-check that FreeImage and ImageScience are installed.)

The migration creates an admin user with password "admin".

### Loading sample data

Now load the sample data and start the server:

$ rake db:sample_data:reload
$ script/server

The rake task loads sample data to make developing easier.  All the sample users have email logins <name>@example.com, with password foobar.  

Go to http://localhost:3000 and log in as follows:

email: michael@example.com
password: foobar

Now open the source code with your favorite editor and start hacking!

## Stat tracker

Note that there is a minimalist stat tracker that lets us keep track of how many different installs of Isoshi are out there.  We don't collect any personal information, but if you don't want to be tracked just open application.html.erb and comment out the line after this one:

<%# A tracker to tell us about the activity of Insoshi installs %>
