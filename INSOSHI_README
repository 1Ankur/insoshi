Here's how to start with Insoshi.

$ git clone git://67.207.136.60/instantsocial.git
$ cp config/database.example config/database.yml
$ cp config/initializers/preferences.rb.example \
     config/initializers/preferences.rb
$ git checkout -b <your name>
$ rake db:migrate:both
$ rake

It might fail at this point.  If the error message indicates a problem with the Photo controller, follow these directions to install ImageScience:

Download FreeImage from http://freeimage.sourceforge.net/download.html
(no ./configure step)
$ make
$ sudo make install 
$ sudo gem install image_science

If working on developing the application, continue by loading the sample data.

$ rake db:sample_data:load

To reload the sample data later on, run
$ rake db:sample_data:reload

Go to http://localhost:3000 and log in as (say) michael@example.com (password foobar).

Note: there is a minimalist stat tracker that lets us keep track of how many different installs of Isoshi are out there.  We don't collect any personal information, but if you don't want to be tracked just comment out the line after 
<%# A tracker to tell us about the activity of Insoshi installs %>
