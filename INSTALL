Here's how to get started with Insoshi.

# Get Git

The source code to Insoshi is hosted by Git, so install it first from

http://git.or.cz/

Linux and Mac users should have no problems; Windows users might have to install Cygwin (http://cygwin.com/) first.

# Install libraries and gems

## Libraries

You'll need to install FreeImage, SQLite, and MySQL.  Install instructions for all three are trivial to find on Google.

## Gems

You probably have Rails already, but might not have the others.

$ sudo gem install rails
$ sudo gem install image_science
$ sudo gem install ferret
$ sudo gem install mysql
$ sudo gem install sqlite3-ruby

# Installing the app

Here are the step to get up and running with the Rails app

## Git steps

$ git clone git://git.insoshi.com/insoshi.git
$ git checkout -b <firstname_lastname>

where you should replace <firstname_lastname> with your name (without angle brackets!)

At some later point, follow the steps at 

http://trac.insoshi.com/insoshi/wiki/ContributingBack

Also be sure to get in the habit of syncing with the main repository:

$ git add .
$ git commit -v
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout <firstname_lastname>
$ git rebase master

## Config files and tests

Now create the config files and run the tests (which are actually RSpec examples in the spec/ directory):

$ cp config/database.example config/database.yml
$ cp config/initializers/preferences.rb.example \
     config/initializers/preferences.rb
$ rake db:migrate:both
$ rake spec

(If the tests fail in the Photos controller test, double-check that FreeImage and ImageScience are installed.)

## Loading sample data

Now load the sample data and start the server:

$ rake db:sample_data:reload
$ script/server

The rake task loads sample data to make developing easier.  All the sample users have email logins <name>@example.com, with password foobar.  

Go to http://localhost:3000 and log in as michael@example.com (password foobar) to get started.

# Stat tracker

Note that there is a minimalist stat tracker that lets us keep track of how many different installs of Isoshi are out there.  We don't collect any personal information, but if you don't want to be tracked just open application.html.erb and comment out the line after this one:

<%# A tracker to tell us about the activity of Insoshi installs %>
